The source code for the following paper:

  Detection of Adversarial Examples in Deep Neural Networks with Natural Scene Statistics

is downloaded from the upstream author:

	https://github.com/KHERCHOUCHE-ANOUAR/Detection-of-Adversarial-Examples-in-Deep-Neural-Networks-with-Natural-Scene-Statistics

I made a lot bugfixes to the upstream code in order to make the upstream code
run without error. Sigh.
